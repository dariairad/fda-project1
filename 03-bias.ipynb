    "\n",
    "It becomes more problematic when confirmation bias distorts our active pursuit of facts. If the worldviews of a Person B match those of a controversial politician, they will watch and follow them not for information, but rather for confirmation. For example, they will reach for publications that show the politician in a positive light and avoid those that may challenge their views.\n"

    "The hindsight bias  is our tendency to look back at an event that we could not predict at the time and make these events seem more predictable after-the-fact. After learning something new, it may also make us quickly redact our pasts so we can feel the comfort of always being right (McRaney 2011).\n",

    "For example, investors may be exposed to the hindsight bias after passing on a later successful investment. A big scale example of this was the 80s Computer Debut. In the 80s, there was a big interest in tech, industrials, and materials\n",
    "but a lot of investors were staying away from debut-making computer software and hardware. After the enormous success of companies like Apple or Microsoft, hundreds of investors most likely regreted not making an investment in the sector, even thou they claimed they have \"saw it coming\" all along (Chen 2022)."
