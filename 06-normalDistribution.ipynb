    "The normal probability distribution, one of the fundamental continuous distributions of statistics, is actually a family of distributions (an infinite number of distributions with differing means (μ) and standard deviations (σ).  Because the normal distribution is a continuous distribution, we can not calculate exact probability for an outcome, but instead we calculate a probability for a range of outcomes (for example the probability that a random variable X is greater than 10.

As the notation indicates, the normal distribution depends only on the mean and the standard deviation. Note that this is unlike several probability density functions we have already studied, such as the Poisson, where the mean is equal to μ and the standard deviation simply the square root of the mean, or the binomial, where p is used to determine both the mean and standard deviation. Since the area under the curve must equal one, a change in the standard deviation, σ, causes a change in the shape of the normal curve; the curve becomes fatter and wider or skinnier and taller depending on σ. A change in μ causes the graph to shift to the left or right. This means there are an infinite number of normal probability distributions. One of special interest is called the standard normal distribution. (Holmes et al 2017)"
